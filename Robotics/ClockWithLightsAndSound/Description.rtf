\f0\fs28 \cf0 For our final project, we combined LEDs, the LCD display, push buttons, and sound buzzer to create a clock. The hour, minutes, and seconds were displayed on the LCD and could be reset using each of the three push buttons. We incorporated 3 LEDs that blinked at the top of every hour, minute, and second. Finally, the sound buzzer sounded at the top of every hour. This final projects combined all concepts previously learned in other labs, and we also had to do additional research to learn how to connect and code the sound buzzer. Our motivation was to challenge ourselves by combining everything we learned so far in class. We used class notes and online resources to complete this project.\
